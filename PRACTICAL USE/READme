### Getting Started with Docusaurus

Open up the terminal within vscode

We will begin by using Docusaurus's quick start command:  

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

1. **Proceed**: When prompted, type `y` to continue.  
2. **Choose Language**: You will be asked to use either JavaScript or TypeScript.  
   Use the arrow keys to make your selection. (I will use **TypeScript**.)
